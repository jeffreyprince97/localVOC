    This assessment tool consisting of 12 items, rates the surgeon performing an endoscopic ultrasound procedure on a scale from 1-5, from the insertion of the endoscope to the end of the procedure.
    
    The twelve items cover:

    <ul>
    <li>Insertion of the endoscope (item 1).</li>
    <li>Presentation of anatomical landmarks (items 2 – 8).</li>
    <li>Biopsy sampling (items 9 – 12).</li>
    </ul>  
    
    All items are rated on 5-point-scales with descriptive word anchors at the ends and in the middle. </br>

    Here is a general description of the requirements to receive either 2 or 4 points on an item:

    <ul>
    <li>2-points: The bad performance which only partly solves the given task with some to many insecurities and meaningful mistakes.</li>
    <li>4 points: The excellent performance which solves the given task with some minor mistakes or insecurities.</li>
    </ul>  
    
    When accessing, the five-point rating scale should be recoded from 1-5 points to 0-4 points, which will result in a maximum score of 40 points on the 10 items. </br>
    To ensure the most valid results from this assessment tool, you should aim to complete the assessment as close to the performance of the surgery as possible, ideally during the procedure, to combat recall bias. </br>
    This assessment should be performed without regards for the surgeons education level and previous experience. It is therefore to be expected that the inexperienced surgeon will score relatively lower than the experienced. That way it will be possible to keep track of any progression in the surgeons technical skills.
