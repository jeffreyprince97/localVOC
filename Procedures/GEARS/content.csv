SCALE;Depth perception;1;5;1;Constantly overshoots target, wide swings, slow to correct;3;Some overshooting or missing of target, but quick to correct;5;Accurately direct instruments in the correct plane to target;
SCALE;Bimanual dexterity;1;5;1;Uses only one hand, ignores nondominant hand, poor coordination;3;Uses both hands, but does not optimize interaction between hands;5;Expertly uses both hands in a complementary way to provide best exposure;
SCALE;Efficiency;1;5;1;Inefficient efforts; many uncertain movements; constantly changing focus or persisting without progress;3;Slow, planned movements are reasonably organized;5;Confident, efficient and safe conduct, maintains focus on task, fluid progression;
SCALE;Force sensitivity;1;5;1;Rough moves, tears tissue, injures nearby structures, poor control, frequent suture breakage;3;Handles tissues reasonably well, minor trauma to adjacent tissure, rare suture breakage;5;Applies appropriate tension, negligible injury to adjacent strucutres, no suture breakage;
SCALE;Autonomy;1;5;1;Unable to complete entire task, even with verbal guidance;3;Able to complete task safely with moderate guidance;5;Able to complete task independently without prompting;
SCALE;Robotic control;1;5;1;Consistently does not optimize view, hand position, or repeated collisions even with guidance;3;View is sometimes not optimal. Occasionally needs to relocate arms. Occasional collisions and obstruction of assistant;5;Controls camera and hand position optimally and independently. Minimal collisions or obstruction of assistants;
