This assessment tool consisting of 5 items, rates the physician performing a point-of-care ultrasonography (POC US) procedure on a scale from 1-5, focusing on procedure- and equipment aspects, but also the physician’s interpretation and documentation abilities. </br>

The tool achieves a generalizability coefficient of above 0.8, which is needed for high stakes assessment, when using 2 raters and presenting the physician with 4 different cases to be assessed on. Alternatively, a single rater assessing 5 cases yields the same coefficient.</br>

All items are rated on 5-point-scales with descriptive word anchors at the ends and in the middle.</br>

Here is a general description of the requirements to receive either 2 or 4 points on an item:

<ul>
<li> 2-points: The bad performance which only partly solves the given task with some to many insecurities and meaningful mistakes </li>
<li> 4 points: The excellent performance which solves the given task with some minor mistakes or insecurities </li>
</ul>

A maximum of 60 points can be achieved from the 12 items on the 5-point-scale.</br>

To ensure the most valid results from this assessment tool, you should aim to complete the assessment as close to the performance of the surgery as possible, ideally during the procedure, to combat recall bias.</br>

This assessment should be performed without regards for the surgeon’s education level and previous experience. It is therefore to be expected that the inexperienced surgeon will score relatively lower than the experienced. That way it will be possible to keep track of any progression in the surgeons’ technical skills.
